    <p class="home-text">
        Snake is the common name for a video game concept where the player maneuvers a line which grows in length,
        with the line itself being a primary obstacle. The concept originated in the 1976 arcade game Blockade, and
        the ease of implementing Snake has led to hundreds of versions (some of which have the word snake or worm in
        the title) for many platforms. After a variant was preloaded on Nokia mobile phones in 1998, there was a resurgence
        of interest in the snake concept as it found a larger audience. There are over 420 Snake-like games for iOS alone.

        The player controls a dot, square, or object on a bordered plane. As it moves forward,
        it leaves a trail behind, resembling a moving snake. In some games, the end of the trail
        is in a fixed position, so the snake continually gets longer as it moves. In another
        common scheme, the snake has a specific length, so there is a moving tail a fixed number
        of units away from the head. The player loses when the snake runs into the screen border,
        a trail, other obstacle, or itself.
        The first known personal computer version of Snake, titled Worm, was programmed in 1978
        by Peter Trefonas of the US on the TRS-80 computer, and published by CLOAD magazine in
        the same year.

        In the original version of Snake, the player can choose between three different levels,
        and the goal was to try and eliminate all snakes on each level. But in many versions,
        the levels are combined to create multiple levels in one, thus increasing the fun factor
        of the game.

        This humble website is a place where you can - you guessed it - play this classic game but now written in JavaScript!
        Not only you can play it but also compete with other players for the highest score and have access to the source
        code for the game!

    <p class="home-text">
        As you might have read above, there are a lot of different versions of this game, with different gameplays
        and objectives. The version you will find in here is the most popular: survive for as long you can! You can
        either play it the easy way (no borders) or the hard way (deadly borders). It is up to you.  There is also a
        growth level feature, in which you start as SLUG and grow to be a SNAKE or even a PYTHON. At each level, the 
        velocity of growth inscreases and, consequently, the difficulty as well.

        If you like better the retro gameboy color scheme, besides choosing the difficulty, you can also choose the style.
        In the game menu you can shoose between the classic style or the modern one!
